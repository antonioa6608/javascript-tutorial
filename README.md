today i learned about using classes with javascript, similar to python you have a parent class such as HospitalEmployee and the subclass such as Nurse and Doctor. 
A constructor which holds the instances/ properties such as the name etc.
getters which gets the instances in the constructor 
creating a instance so for example const doctorAlexander = new Doctor('Alexander', 'true');
to print out the value stored it would be something like this , console.log(doctorAlexander);

# To conconlude : classes make your code from readable and efficent when trying to write the same code over and over.
